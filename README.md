# Project: Cherry - SpaceX Launch Tracker
Cherry is an open-source unofficial SpaceX launch tracker app, built for fun and with educational purposes. 

### About the project

The app has been developed to be light-weight, fast and easy to use. It takes all the data from the open-source REST r/SpaceX API found [here](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API).

## Features
* **Launch tracking & details**: Detailed list of past & upcoming launches.

* **Core & capsules details**: More information about each core & capsules launched.
