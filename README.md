# Project: Cherry - SpaceX Launch Tracker

Cherry is an open-source unofficial SpaceX launch tracker app, built for fun and with educational purposes. 

### About the project

The only purpose of thsi project is to start developing hybird mobile apps with the Flutter SDK. This SDK allows me to port this app to Android & iOS with ease. It is light-weight, fast and easy to use. It takes all the data from the open-source REST r/SpaceX API found [here](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API). 

## Download & install

First, clone the repository with the 'clone' command, or just download the zip.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:jesusrp98/cherry.git
```

Then, download either Android Studio or Visual Studio Code, with their respective [Flutter editor plugins](https://flutter.io/get-started/editor/).

There you go, you can now open & edit the project. Enjoy!
