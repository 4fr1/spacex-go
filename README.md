# SpaceX GO! - Launch Tracker
SpaceX GO! - codenamed Project: Cherry, is an open-source unofficial SpaceX launch tracker app, built for fun and with educational purposes. 

### About the project
The only purpose of this project is to start developing hybird mobile apps with the Flutter SDK. This SDK allows me to port this app to Android & iOS with ease. The app has been developed to be light-weight, fast and easy to use. It takes all the data from the open-source REST r/SpaceX API found [here](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API).

## Features
* **Launch tracking & details**: Detailed list of past & upcoming launches.
* **Vehicle catalogue**: Read about all rockets, capsules & ships SpaceX has develop over the years.
* **Tesla Roadster tracker**: Orbit, speed & distance of the Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster.
* **Core & capsules details**: More information about each core & capsules launched.
